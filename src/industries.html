          Membrane contactors are increasingly being used in the power generation industry to address various challenges related to water treatment, corrosion control, and operational efficiency. Dissolved gases, particularly oxygen (O₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂), can cause significant corrosion and pitting in power plant components such as boilers, pipes, and heat exchangers.

          This can lead to increased maintenance costs and reduced equipment lifespan. Therefore removal of those dissolved gas is mandated by every country's safety laws. Membrane Contactors are used to remove dissolved gases from boiler feedwater. These contactors can reduce dissolved O₂ levels to below 1 ppb and CO₂ levels to below 1 ppm.

        <p class="mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Performance:</span> The 35t/h deaerator reduced the dissolved O₂ in water up to 1ppb. Therefore, the dissolved O₂ level in condensing water lowered as less than 3ppb.

          <span class="font-bold">Energy Savings:</span> As to the thermal deaerator, there is no need to remove O₂ in water and the vent valve shut down completely, which saved 14956t of steam per year.
